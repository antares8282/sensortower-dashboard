The number above its head is its ammo: that\u2019s how many hits it makes. Run out and it leaves the stage; if not, it slips into one of the 5 waiting slots and, when you tap again, it jumps back on the conveyor to fire another round.\nThe conveyor has a capacity\u2014push past the limit and you\u2019ll need to wait. Send them in the right order, manage the flow, and hit the cubes to clear the board piece by piece. Simple mechanic, sticky loop: tap \u2192 flow \u2192 repeat.\nHighlights\nOne-tap control: Quick sessions, easy one-handed play.\nColor matching: Pigs only hit their own color\u2014no target-picking hassle.\nConveyor capacity: Timing and queue management add a bite-size strategy layer.\n5 waiting slots: Stack, sort, and launch at the perfect moment.\nShort but \u201cone more round\u201d feel: Perfect for micro-breaks.\nSatisfying pixel cleanup: Every hit leaves the board feeling crisp.\nFor anyone who loves fast action-puzzles, timing, and flow management. The pigs are ready. The cubes\u2026 not so much.",

          "description": "Pure instant messaging \u2014 simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the top 5 most downloaded apps in the world with over 1 billion active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don\u2019t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE &amp; OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content \u2014 messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don\u2019t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram \u2014 join the revolution today.\n\nTerms of Use: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/",

That\u2019s about 2000 videos of your cat. Share photos and videos in their original format, including all the important EXIF metadata that originates from your camera. With WeTransfer, you can check the download status, forward, and delete transfers right from your phone. If you previously sent a transfer from your laptop, you can access the files and link in the app, so you can easily paste it into your favorite messaging app without needing to open your computer. Our Live Activity notifies you when a transfer finishes uploading, so you can multitask or play a quick game while sending huge files. Notifications let you know the minute you receive something so you can preview (or download) your files wherever you are.\n\nAbout us\nHaving made our name in the game of quick and simple file-sharing, WeTransfer has grown into a collection of tools designed for and inspired by the creative process. Collect is the go-to app for saving and sharing inspiration in boards that organize your ideas. Portals makes it easy to request feedback on your in progress projects with Reviews that include asset markup and approval flows.
