          "description": "WeTransfer is the simplest way to send (and receive) big files. Whether you\u2019re at your desk or on the go, transfer up to 200 GB in one go. That\u2019s about 2000 videos of your cat. Share photos and videos in their original format, including all the important EXIF metadata that originates from your camera. With WeTransfer, you can check the download status, forward, and delete transfers right from your phone. If you previously sent a transfer from your laptop, you can access the files and link in the app, so you can easily paste it into your favorite messaging app without needing to open your computer. Our Live Activity notifies you when a transfer finishes uploading, so you can multitask or play a quick game while sending huge files. Notifications let you know the minute you receive something so you can preview (or download) your files wherever you are.\n\nAbout us\nHaving made our name in the game of quick and simple file-sharing, WeTransfer has grown into a collection of tools designed for and inspired by the creative process. Collect is the go-to app for saving and sharing inspiration in boards that organize your ideas. Portals makes it easy to request feedback on your in progress projects with Reviews that include asset markup and approval flows. WeTransfer is the original web platform, where creatives share their biggest files.\n\nTerms of Service: https://wetransfer.com/legal/terms\nPrivacy policy: https://wetransfer.com/legal/privacy",

          "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off of dating apps. With profiles that show your personality through text, photos, video, and voice, you have unique conversations that lead to great dates. And it\u2019s working. Currently, people on Hinge go on a date every three seconds. Additionally, in 2022, we were the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nWhen it comes to online dating, people are so busy matching that they\u2019re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that\u2019s designed to be deleted. Here\u2019s how:\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You\u2019ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone\u2019s personality. You\u2019ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, as well as information like religion, height, politics, dating intentions, relationship type, and much more.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile. Our latest feature, Convo Starters, offers personalized ideas inspired from someone\u2019s Prompt answers and photos to help you spark engaging conversations from the start. \n\n* We want you to feel confident about meeting people in person. Selfie Verification makes it easier for daters on Hinge to ensure that they are who they say they are.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we\u2019ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see everyone who likes them or send unlimited likes can upgrade to Hinge+. To access additional features, including enhanced recommendations and priority likes, we offer HingeX.\n\nPRESS\n\"It's the go-to dating app for many people looking for love.\" - The Daily Mail\n\u201cHinge\u2019s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.\u201d - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html\n\nAll photos are of models and used for illustrative purposes only.",

The League is a selective dating app offering its members a curated \u201cBatch\u201d of potentials each day, rather than an unlimited stream of profiles.

So say goodbye to endless swiping and keep those standards sky-high\u2014 because while your mother might call you picky, we call you self-aware.\n\n\nThe League uses an application process to ensure a well-balanced, highly engaged community of people with real motivation to find a meaningful long-term relationship. You can use The League for free or upgrade to a subscription to unlock additional benefits. Subscribers see more profiles each day, and thus, enjoy 40% more matches on average.\n\nSubscription Details: Payment will be charged to Apple Account at confirmation of purchase.
